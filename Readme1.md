## Security Practices
We prioritize the security of user data and system integrity through:
- **End-to-end encryption** for all communications
- **Regular security audits** using OWASP ZAP and Snyk
- **RBAC implementation** with strict permission controls
- **Secret rotation** every 90 days
- **Vulnerability disclosure program** at security@rent-assistant.ru

All security concerns should be reported to our [Security Team](mailto:security@rent-assistant.ru).
