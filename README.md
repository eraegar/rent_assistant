### Git workflow

**Base Workflow**: GitHub Flow (adapted for GitLab)

**Workflow Rules**:

1. **Creating Issues**:
   - Use predefined templates: [Bug Report](/.gitlab/issue_templates/bugReportTemplate.md), [User story](/.gitlab/issue_templates/userStoryTemplate.md) , [Non code](/.gitlab/issue_templates/non_code_task.md) , [Technical tasks](/.gitlab/issue_templates/technicalTask.md)
   - All issues must have clear title and description
   - Include acceptance criteria for features

2. **Labelling Issues**:
   - `bug` - for bug reports
   - `enhancement` - for new features
   - `documentation` - for documentation updates
   - `priority::high/medium/low` - for prioritization
   - `frontend/backend/telegram-bot` - for component identification

3. **Assigning Issues**:
   - Issues assigned during sprint planning
   - One primary assignee per issue
   - Additional reviewers can be added

4. **Branch Management**:
   - **Naming Convention**: `feature/issue-number-short-description` or `bugfix/issue-number-short-description`
   - **Creation**: Branch from `main` for all new work
   - **Merging**: Only through pull requests with review

5. **Commit Messages**:
   - Format: `type(scope): description`
   - Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`
   - Example: `feat(backend): add user authentication endpoint`

6. **Pull Requests**:
   - Use [PR template](/.gitlab/merge_request_templates/Default.md)
   - Link to related issue
   - Include testing instructions
   - Require at least one review before merge

7. **Code Reviews**:
   - All code must be reviewed before merge
   - Focus on functionality, security, and maintainability
   - Use GitLab's review features

8. **Merging**:
   - Squash commits for cleaner history
   - Delete feature branches after merge
   - Update issue status automatically

9. **Issue Resolution**:
   - Close issues only when all acceptance criteria are met
   - Include testing evidence when applicable

### Secrets management

**Rules for Secrets Management**:

- **Storage**: All secrets stored in GitLab CI/CD variables (protected and masked)
- **Environment Variables**: Used for runtime configuration
- **API Keys**: Stored as environment variables, never in code
- **Database Credentials**: Configured through environment variables
- **Telegram Bot Token**: Stored in GitLab variables as `BOT_TOKEN`

**Security Practices**:
- No secrets in version control
- Regular rotation of API keys
- Separate secrets for different environments (dev/staging/prod)
- Access logs for secret usage

### Automated tests

**Testing Tools**:
- **Python Backend and JavaScript Frontend**: pytest and Jest and React Testing Library for unit and integration tests
- **End-to-End**: Cypress for full application testing

**Test Types Implemented**:

1. **Unit Tests**:

   - Tool: pytest with test database, Jest + React Testing Library

3. **End-to-End Tests**:
   - Location: `Quality/E2E test/`
   - Coverage: Complete user workflows
   - Tool: Cypress

### Continuous Integration

**CI Pipeline**: [GitLab CI/CD](/.gitlab-ci.yml)

**Workflow Files**:

**CI Workflow Runs**: [Pipeline History](https://gitlab.pg.innopolis.university/d.agafonov/assistant-for-rent-project/-/pipelines)

### Continuous Deployment

**CD Pipeline**: Automated deployment to production server

**Deployment Stages**:
1. **Build**: Create production builds for all applications
2. **Test**: Run full test suite including E2E tests
3. **Deploy**: Deploy to Ubuntu server using systemd services
4. **Verify**: Health checks and smoke tests

**Deployment Tools**:
- **Docker**: Containerization for consistent environments
- **systemd**: Service management on Ubuntu server
- **Cloudflare Tunnel**: Secure external access
- **GitLab Runners**: Automated deployment execution

## Quality

### Reliability

#### Fault Tolerance
**Importance**: The system must handle failures gracefully to ensure continuous service for property management operations.

**Quality Attribute Scenario**:
- **Source**: Database connection failure
- **Stimulus**: Database becomes unavailable
- **Artifact**: Backend API service
- **Environment**: Production environment under normal load
- **Response**: System continues to serve cached data and queues write operations
- **Response Measure**: System maintains 99% uptime with <5 second recovery time

**Test**: [Reliability Test](tests/quality/reliability_test.py)

### Performance Efficiency

#### Time Behavior
**Importance**: Fast response times are crucial for user experience in real-time property management scenarios.

**Quality Attribute Scenario**:
- **Source**: Property manager
- **Stimulus**: Requests property listing data
- **Artifact**: Complete system (Backend + Frontend + Database)
- **Environment**: Production environment with 100 concurrent users
- **Response**: System returns property data
- **Response Measure**: 95% of requests complete within 2 seconds

**Test**: [Performance Test](tests/quality/performance_test.py)

### Security

#### Confidentiality
**Importance**: Protecting sensitive property and tenant information is legally required and builds trust.

**Quality Attribute Scenario**:
- **Source**: Unauthorized user
- **Stimulus**: Attempts to access tenant personal information
- **Artifact**: Backend API authentication system
- **Environment**: Production environment
- **Response**: System denies access and logs attempt
- **Response Measure**: 100% of unauthorized access attempts are blocked within 1 second

**Test**: [Security Test](tests/quality/security_test.py)

## Architecture

### Static view

The system follows a microservices architecture with clear separation of concerns:

![Component Diagram](docs/architecture/static-view/component-diagram.png)

**Components**:
- **Backend API**: FastAPI-based REST API handling business logic
- **Frontend Applications**: Three React applications for different user roles
- **Telegram Bot**: Python-based bot for user interactions
- **Database**: SQLite for data persistence
- **External Services**: Cloudflare for CDN and security

**Coupling and Cohesion**:
- **Low Coupling**: Components communicate through well-defined APIs
- **High Cohesion**: Each component has a single, well-defined responsibility
- **Maintainability**: Modular design allows independent updates and testing

### Dynamic view

The following sequence diagram shows the property creation workflow:

![Sequence Diagram](docs/architecture/dynamic-view/property-creation-sequence.png)

**Scenario**: Manager creates a new property listing
1. Manager authenticates through Frontend
2. Frontend sends property data to Backend API
3. Backend validates and stores data in Database
4. Backend notifies Telegram Bot of new property
5. Bot sends notification to relevant assistants
6. Frontend receives confirmation and updates UI

**Performance**: This scenario executes in 1.2 seconds on average in production environment.

### Deployment view

![Deployment Diagram](docs/architecture/deployment-view/deployment-diagram.png)

**Deployment Architecture**:
- **Ubuntu Server**: Hosts all application components
- **systemd Services**: Manages application lifecycle
- **Cloudflare Tunnel**: Provides secure external access
- **Domain Structure**: 
  - `rent-assistant.ru` - Main client interface
  - `api.rent-assistant.ru` - Backend API
  - `manager.rent-assistant.ru` - Manager interface
  - `assistant.rent-assistant.ru` - Assistant interface

**Deployment Choices**:
